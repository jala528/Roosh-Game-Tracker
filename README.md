# Game-Tracker
A game collection and progress tracker

Wanted to learn HTML solely to create a game collection site that fits my need. Lots of other sites and apps I've used put a lot of emphisis on resale value, and as someone with an extensive Steam & Xbox library, that not an option for me so I won't bother. 

I started to use My Game Collection app which has been adequate for the most part and what inspired me to make my own version. Something to track what I have, want, a relative indication of where I am in the game, and Platinum/Mastering a game.


What I'm trying to accomplish.
